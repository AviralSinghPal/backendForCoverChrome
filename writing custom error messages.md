# Why to use Custom errors?

Benefits of Custom Error Messages
Using custom error messages provides several benefits in application development:

1. Meaningful Communication
Custom error messages allow us to communicate specific error details to users and developers. By providing descriptive and contextual messages, we can make it easier for developers to understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.

2. Error Code Standardization
By associating error codes with custom error messages, we can create a standardized system for identifying and handling different types of errors. This helps in maintaining consistency across the application and facilitates efficient debugging and error resolution.

3. Improved Error Handling
Custom error messages enable developers to handle different types of errors more effectively. With specific error codes and messages, we can implement error-specific logic and take appropriate actions, such as retrying the operation, redirecting the user, or logging the error for further analysis.


# Custom Error Messages in Your Application

Errors are an integral part of any application's development process. They help us identify and handle exceptional scenarios and communicate relevant information to users and developers. While most programming languages provide built-in error types, sometimes it becomes necessary to create custom error messages tailored to specific requirements. In this article, we will explore how to create custom error messages using JavaScript, specifically by extending the `Error` class.

## Extending the `Error` Class

JavaScript allows us to extend the `Error` class to create our own custom error types. By extending this class, we can define additional properties and methods to customize error handling and provide meaningful error messages. Let's look at an example:

```javascript
class CustomError extends Error {
    constructor(message, code) {
        super(message);
        this.code = code;
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we define a CustomError class that extends the Error class. It takes two parameters: message and code. The message parameter represents the error message, while the code parameter can be used to associate a specific error code with the custom error.

Customizing Error Messages
Once we have our custom error class defined, we can utilize it to create instances of custom errors with unique error messages and codes. Here's an example of how to use the CustomError class:

```javascript

try {
    // Perform some operation that may throw an error
    throw new CustomError("An error occurred.", 500);
} catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error code: ${error.code}`);
    console.error(`Error message: ${error.message}`);
}
```
In the above code, we create a new instance of the CustomError class and throw it within a try-catch block. By catching the error, we can access and utilize the error code and message properties defined in the CustomError class.


Conclusion
Creating custom error messages using the Error class in JavaScript allows us to tailor error handling and communication in our applications. By extending the Error class and defining additional properties and methods, we can provide meaningful error messages and associate them with error codes. This customization enhances the overall development experience and facilitates efficient debugging and error resolution.

Remember, while custom error messages can be powerful, it's essential to strike a balance between providing enough information for effective troubleshooting and avoiding exposing sensitive details that could be exploited by attackers.

By leveraging the flexibility offered by custom error messages, you can improve the robustness and user experience of your application.
